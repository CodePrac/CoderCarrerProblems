/*
Numbers are serialized increasingly into a sequence in the format of 0123456789101112131415..., 
which each digit occupies a position in the sequence. 
For instance, the digit in the position 5 is 5, in the position 13 is 1, in the position 19 is 4, and so on.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1  0  1  1  1  2  1  3  1  4  1  5
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

Please write a function/method to get the digit on any given position.
